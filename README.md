# Unity-UserManifestModifier
This is a Unity3D package for making quick modifications to a collab project's manifest.

The purpose is to bridge the gap for when working with multiple unity devs and the manifest needs to change slightly per dev.
A good example is how one dev might be working on iOS and another on Android, as such there may be packages that need to be Added, Removed, or Swapped.
Lastly, there is the ability to redirect Local packages, so manifest changes get updated.

The goal of this is to run automatically, but right now it is still a work in progress.
